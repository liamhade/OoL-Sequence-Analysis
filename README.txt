VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT:
	
This package uses the Python built-in "venv" module
for managing its virtual environment.

To activate the virtual environment, simply navigate to the this folder (ool_lab_venv),
and type ".\Script\activate."

For running the analysis notebook in Jupyter, there should already be a kernel created
from this virtual env.
